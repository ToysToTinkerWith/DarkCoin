# pages/components

Folder containing all the web components used to process and render the application. 

Developed under the Next.js framework, the logic of the appication can be understood through the sequential rendering of the components beggining with the pages/index file. A user can see what APIs/SDKs are being used, and how the data from the Algorand Blockchain is processed to create the Dark Coin Application. The goal for this project is to be as open as possible, in ensuring trust, and creating transparency within the community.

# Council

The Council is a place where users can propose changes to the Dark Coin Project, and vote on proposals with their Dark Coin DAO NFTs.
To use the Council, one must click the Council Icon located at:

https://dark-coin.com/council

The user is presented with 2 options:

## Propose

A connected wallet may propose a change or addition to the Dark Coin Project. The user is allowed to type 2000 characters into the textfield provided, to persuade the DAO of their idea. This transaction will cost the wallet 20 Algo as initial funding for the proposal. A new contract will be made, and the 20 Algo will be sent to the new proposal contract address.

## Proposals

A user will see a list of Dark Coin proposals made to the Council. Clicking on a proposal will open up more detailed information about that proposal.

### Apply

Any connected wallet may apply to a proposal made to the Council. The user will have 50 to 2000 characters to convince the DAO to accept their application. This might include introducing oneself, explaining how you will accomplish the proposal, and any changes you might make to the proposal. The applicant also must input what round they expect to complete the proposal by, and how much they expect to gain in Dark Coin for completing the task. This transaction will cost 50 Dark Coin per character to go to the proposer, plus 0.5 Algo to cover the minimum balance requirement. 

### Vote

Anyone with a Dark Coin DAO NFT may use it to vote on proposals made to the Council smart contract. Members of the DAO may choose to either "accept" an application from a Dark Coin community member, or "reject" the proposal. After 604800 rounds (2 weeks), the votes are finalized and a transaction to accept or reject the proposal is pushed to the chain. 

If the application is accepted, the applicant is contracted to the job. The contracter will have the amount of rounds specified by the application. At the end of the contract period, a satisfaction vote will occur from the DAO determining how much of the payout the contracter should recieve.
